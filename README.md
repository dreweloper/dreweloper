🚀 Latest Project: "Blue" - A quiz that calculates your water footprint 💧

"Blue" is a project I recently worked on. It is an interactive water footprint calculator that helps raise awareness of people's water consumption and promotes sustainable practices. The app classifies users as "Saver" or "Spender" according to their water consumption and provides detailed information on their daily consumption, as well as annual expenditure in euros. It also proposes personalized challenges to help users save water, money and contribute to the care of the environment.

You can access the project repository [here](https://github.com/DREWiex/blue-quiz).
